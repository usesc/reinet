INTERNET

Data over distance. Not as simple as it sounds. 
The centralization of the internet, the data 
farming, government meddling. Are we not tired
of it all? The Internet has been flawed from day
1, it needs a complete redesign.

PROPOSAL 

IPV6 Exclusive
Strong P2P enforcement
No manual port forwarding, hole punching or anything  
  of the sort. Connections should be IP to IP, simply.

STANDARDS

DECENTRALIZATION:
Use different tools besides google, amazon, and 
microsoft, I beg of you, just read the stallman
blog or something.

ISP:
No data farming or censorship, government 
interaction should be completely ignored. 

ROUTER:
same as ISP + No backdoors, exploits or anything 
remotely similar. No proprietary router firmware.

ACCESS:
No alive human being should ever be restricted from
internet access. Any website/IP, if even websites like
WatchPeopleDie should be available to everyone.
Completely unrestricted access. Similarly no IP or 
device should not be allowed to access the internet.

GOVERNMENT:
Government cannot sieze websites under no 
circumstance EVER. Piracy is legal. No website or
IP should ever be illegal to connect to. Real 
arrests should be made on actual logic, reasoning
and evidence. Pressuring ISPs to comply with gov 
demands prohibited. Telling websites/ISPs anything 
by order completely prohibited. In summary, no 
government or organization should be able to control
the internet at all. 

SURVEILLANCE:
Completely unjustified. If you want to catch a 
drug deal going on Online, you have to be at the 
right place at the right time just like in life, 
minus the cameras.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
Users of the internet should have the right to 
know if their data is being fed to AI like 
afternoon dinner, transparency is key here.

DATA FARMING:
Just like AI, should be explicit with internet
users.

INET BROWSERS:
goodness theres so much to say here, no data farming,
auditable source code, and transparency about 
exactly what the browser is doing to internet users.

SOFTWARE (General):
All network pertaining software should be able to be 
audited by the general public en masse. Basically, 
consumers should have the right to audit firmware 
or software for everything their data touches, and 
the same can be said for incoming data.

SOFTWARE (2):
Should be compiled languages only, interpreted 
languages are far too slow to handle the requirements
of the internet pipeline. Preferred C, Rust, Go, 
Compiled BASIC, Assembly (be careful). But then 
again im libertarian first in software so idk
do whatever you want. So I guess consider this
a strong suggestion here.

ENCRYPTION:
Not required, data can be as locked down or as out
in the open as we all want. TCP should preferably 
state the encryption algorithm used, while UDP 
just stays like how it is to be honest.

DEVICES:
Each device should have an inet IP, when a computer 
wants to send data to another computer over the 
internet it should just be from one computers IP
to anothers. Any device with an IP should be able to
receive and emit data to any other device with an IP
on the internet.

IP ENCODE:
should be 16 bytes and 16 bytes only, no strings, just
values.

FIREWALLS:
Device-level. If your device can't handle a firewall, 
then it can't handle the internet. Firewalls - auditable.

VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS:
Complicated topic here but. No data farming. Explicit
functionality. 

AUDITS:
Everything in the internet pipeline should be auditable
for the safety of everything the internet wishes to uphold.
